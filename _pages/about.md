Hi! I'm **Your Name**, a software developer with deep experience in **.NET, Azure, and backend architecture**.  

I write about:
- API scalability and design patterns  
- System design interviews and coding techniques  
- Developer workflows and Azure function optimizations  

Outside of code, I enjoy lifting weights, nutrition optimization, and investment research.
