# Machine Learning Model Deployment Platform

A comprehensive platform that simplifies the deployment and management of machine learning models at scale.

## Features

- Automated model versioning and rollback
- REST API endpoints for model inference
- Real-time performance monitoring
- A/B testing capabilities
- Auto-scaling based on load
- Model performance metrics dashboard

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Python, FastAPI
- **ML Framework**: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **Database**: PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions

## Architecture

The platform uses a microservices architecture with separate services for model serving, monitoring, and management.

## Key Achievements

- Reduced model deployment time from days to minutes
- Handles 100,000+ predictions per second
- 99.9% uptime with automatic failover
- Supports multiple ML frameworks

## What I Learned

Building this platform taught me about the challenges of deploying ML models in production, including model versioning, monitoring, and scaling strategies.
