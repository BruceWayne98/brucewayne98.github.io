Building APIs that scale under load goes beyond code — it’s about designing for elasticity.  
In this post, we’ll explore architectural principles that make .NET 8 APIs cloud-ready:

- Async-first request handling  
- Resilient integrations with retry and circuit breaker strategies  
- Event-driven architectures with Azure Event Grid
