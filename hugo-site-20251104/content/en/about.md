Hello! I'm a software engineer passionate about building elegant solutions to complex problems. With several years of full-stack development experience, I've worked on scalable backend systems and intuitive user interfaces.

**What I Do**

I specialize in backend development and DevOps—building robust APIs, microservices, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud infrastructure.

**My Journey**

My path in software development started with curiosity and evolved into a career I love. I believe in continuous learning, clean code, and building software that makes a difference.

**Beyond Code**

When I'm not coding, I read tech blogs, contribute to open-source projects, write about my learnings, and explore new technologies.
